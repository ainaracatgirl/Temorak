# Temorak
Survival and adventure game, you're a nomad ghost that's trapped in an island and you need to survive. Discover all the secrets in the TEMORAK world!

Play at https://jdev.com.es/Temorak/client/

### **Player Safety**
We use the latest version of *jDev gNET* for networking, a secure peer-to-peer hosting library for JS. Please do not tell anyone in-game your password, personal details or credit card information. We will *never* ask for your passwords, as TEMORAK does not use passwords. If your username gets 'stealed', we can only advert and temp-ban the user's IP from the network.
**Stay safe, please!**

### **Temorak for Developers**
For you, this game is fully Open Source but the client is not documented. We maybe document everyting in a **Modder API** in the future. Our servers run **jDev gNET** and that has it's own documentation on it's [GitHub page](https://github.com/JanCraft/jdev-gNET)
